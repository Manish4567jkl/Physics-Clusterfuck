# 🌸 Physics Clusterfuck 🌼  

### A playful physics playground where everything wobbles, tumbles, and reacts in the most satisfying way.  
Tweak **gravity, mass, and wind** in **sandbox mode**, or jump into different game modes where physics takes center stage.  
Expect **soft bounces, unexpected chaos, and a world that feels alive**. More features coming soon!

## ☁️ To-Do List  
☀️ **Chaos Mode** – crank up the unpredictability  
🌊 **Collisions** – make objects react, bounce, and interact naturally  
🏀 **Projectile Physics** – basketballs, soccer balls, maybe even floating jelly cubes?  
🍃 **Thrust & Wind Mechanics** – gentle breezes to full-on gusts  
🎨 **UI Updates** – clean, cozy, and smooth interactions  
🎼 **Sound Effects** – satisfying *boings*, *whooshes*, and playful bounces  

---

## 🎨 Tech Stack  
✨ **JavaScript (Vite)** – fast, lightweight, and modern  
🎭 **Three.js** – soft and smooth 3D visuals  
🎈 **Cannon-es** – realistic but fun 3D physics  
📜 **Matter.js** – 2D physics that just feels right

### 💖 This project is about **playful physics, cozy vibes, and endless fun**.  
🌷 Stay tuned for updates! 🌷
